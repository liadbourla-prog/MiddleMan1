 * yet it was forced to 'unclear' and the booking neither confirmed nor the question answered.
 *
 * Discriminator = the DIFFERENT-DAY check (robust without a DB round-trip):
 *   • a relative-day token (tomorrow / today / next week) → 'revise' (a different resolution)
 *   • a weekday token that DIFFERS from the held slot's weekday → 'revise'
 *   • only the held slot's own weekday mentioned (or no resolvable day) → 'confirm'
 *
 * `heldWeekday` is the local weekday (0=Sun..6=Sat) of the pending slot, or null when none.
 * With no held slot we cannot prove same-day, so a day token is treated as a revision.
